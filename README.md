# TraceFinder - Forensic Scanner Identification

## 1. Project Statement
The aim of this project is to **identify the source scanner device** used to scan a document or image by analyzing the unique patterns or artifacts left behind during the scanning process.  

Each scanner (brand/model) introduces specific noise, texture, or compression traces that can be learned by a machine learning model.  

This project is important in **forensic investigations**, **copyright authentication**, and **document verification tasks**.

## 2. Use Cases

### **1. Digital Forensics**
- **Description:** Determine which scanner was used to forge or duplicate legal documents.  
- **Example:** Detect whether a fake certificate was created using a specific scanner model.

### **2. Document Authentication**
- **Description:** Identify the source of printed and scanned images to detect tampering or fraudulent claims.  
- **Example:** Differentiate between scans from authorized and unauthorized departments.

### **3. Legal Evidence Verification**
- **Description:** Ensure scanned copies submitted in court/legal matters came from known and approved devices.  
- **Example:** Verify that scanned agreements originated from the company’s official scanner.

## 3. Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, students will:
- Understand the concept of **source device identification**.  
- Extract **scanner-specific features** such as noise patterns, frequency domain signals, and artifacts.  
- Train a **classification model** to distinguish among multiple scanners.  
- Evaluate **model accuracy** and visualize **feature importance**.  
- Optionally **deploy a simple app** to upload and identify the scanner source.

## 7. Week-wise Implementation Roadmap

### **Milestone 1: Dataset Collection & Preprocessing**

#### Week 1:
- Collect scanned document samples from different scanner devices (minimum **3–5 models/brands**).  
- Create a labeled dataset (e.g., `scanner_model`, `file_name`, etc.).  
- Analyze basic image properties such as resolution, format, and color channel.

#### Week 2:
- Perform image preprocessing:
  - Resize all images to a fixed dimension.  
  - Convert to grayscale if needed.  
  - Denoise (optional).  
- Normalize and structure the dataset for model training.

---

### **Milestone 2: Feature Engineering & Baseline Modeling**

#### Week 3:
- Extract hand-crafted features such as:
  - Noise patterns.  
  - Frequency domain features (e.g., FFT).  
  - Texture descriptors (e.g., LBP).  
- Visualize differences between scanner outputs (e.g., noise maps).

#### Week 4:
- Train baseline ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).  
- Evaluate using **accuracy** and **confusion matrix**.  
- Log performance and identify limitations of hand-crafted features.

---

### **Milestone 3: Deep Learning Model + Explainability**

#### Week 5:
- Build and train a **CNN model** on the raw image dataset.  
- Use **image augmentation** for generalization (brightness, rotation).  
- Tune **hyperparameters** and track training curves (accuracy/loss).

#### Week 6:
- Evaluate model performance using **accuracy**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.  
- Apply explainability tools such as **SHAP** or **Grad-CAM** to visualize how the model identifies scanner-specific patterns.

---

### **Milestone 4: Deployment & Final Report**

#### Week 7:
- Create a simple UI using **Streamlit** (or any frontend):
  - Upload scanned image.  
  - Get predicted scanner brand/model with confidence score.  
- Log predictions and allow download of results.

#### Week 8:
- Final documentation and formatting.  
- Add system architecture, training results, model comparison, and screenshots.  
- Prepare final presentation slides and demonstrate the working model.
